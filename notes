 NOTES for JS
1. for json data you send only string...
2. search for cors errors they are occured when client and server are on different port
   so we use header which tells to allow .. we put header to every request put it before routes i.e sending response
3. when you have only one arguement you dont neet to put paranthesis for the funtion but for 0 or more it does
4. when you have just one line function and it returns a value remove return and curly
5. const multiply = number => number*2 returns the double of the number
6. you can also import/export more than one module from a file
7. default gives only one single export. when export more you need exact name in curly braces
  7.1. import {baseData} from './utility.js'
  7.2. import {clean} from './utility.js'
  BOTH ARE EXPORTED FROM UTILITY JS AND HAVE SAME NAME IN UTILITY.JS
  or import {data as baseData} from './utility.js'
  or import * as bundled from './utility.js' // import all the modules as an object
8. spread method is ... which adds elements from old array to new array
  8.1 const newArr=[...oldArray,1,2];
  8.2 const newObj={...oldObj, newProps: 5};
9. same as rest .. used to merge list of function arguement into an array
  9.1 function sortArgs(...args){
  return args.sort();
  }
10. Destructuring extracts array elements or object properties and store them in variables (photos taken)
  10.1 ARRAY Destructuring
  10.2 Object Destructuring
11. nos,bool,const n all is primitive type(creates copy of vaue). Object and array are reference type
12. see array methods like map online. it makes a copy though 
13. like web app we cant make a session as some mobile app cant maintain a session 
    instead we return a token. it is a obj that contains sign if its a valid token and info of logged in user
    this can be stored by client and be used in future. we also verify the token to know if its not altered
    It is a json web token = json data(Generally not Encrypted) + Signature(can be verified)
14. we use nodejs web token it is jsonwebtoken (JWT)

***** ONE AWESOME APPROACH TOLD IN THIS VIDEO THAT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO CREATE ROLES FOR THE user
YOU CAN MAKE A NORMAL USER AND ASSIGN ROLES LIKE WHO CAN ACCEPT ORDER OR WHO CAN DELET ANTHER USER ***
